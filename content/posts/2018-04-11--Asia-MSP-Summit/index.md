Thank you for everyone to be the Asia MSP Summit. And this is my pleasure to be selected as HKMSP representative to share HKMSP Highlight. I believe all MSPs would also admit that MSP is a challenging but rewarding program, so am I.

## Feeling

It is an unforgetable experience for me, I have met many friends from different countries. We exchange our culture and experience. 

I hope I have opportunies to meet them again in the future.
